# Oh Rust. The light of my life, fire of my loins. Years of C++ has conditioned
# me to believe there was no hope left, but the gods have heard us. Sure, you're
# not going to replace C/C++. Sure, your starlight popularity has been
# overblown. Sure, macros aren't namespaced, cargo bypasses crates.io, and there
# is no formal proof of your claims for safety, but who said you have to solve
# all the world's problems to be wonderful?
