# How this works

# What's in scope for this: 
This folder should only install the packages, for example: 

1. Install hyprland
2. Install firefox 

## What's not in scope for this:

These modules will not install the configuration for the package.
So for example:

1. You enable nvim
2. You expected it to come configured

*It won't be configured.*
