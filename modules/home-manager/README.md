# How this works

# What's in scope for this: 
This folder should only configure the packages, for example: 

1. Configure hyprland
2. Configure firefox 

## What's not in scope for this:

These modules will not install the packages for the configuration.
So for example:

1. You enable nvim ( nyyom )
2. You expect nvim to come with it.

*That won't happen.*
