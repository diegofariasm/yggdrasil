= Templates
:toc:

These are my templates similarly structured to link:https://github.com/NixOS/templates[official Nix templates].
The templates will then be exported as part of `templates` attribute to the flake output.

You can then use it for whatever you want to start with.

[source, shell]
----
nix flake init $FLAKE#$TEMPLATE
----

While the folder structure can be a free-for-all, it is much more preferable to have a top-level list of directories with each containing one template.
