= graphical-installer, the personalized graphical installer for NixOS

My other personalized NixOS installation medium.
Similar to `bootstrap`, it isn't supposed to be used as a daily system (if you are, you're still pretty weird :/).
This is based from the GNOME graphical installer from nixpkgs.
Also uses my link:../../modules/nixos/themes/a-happy-gnome[A happy GNOME theme].

To make use of this, you can generate an ISO through link:https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators[nixos-generators]. footnote:[You can also try this for other hosts as well for MORE BEEFY OFFLINE INSTALLATION MEDIUM!]

[source, shell]
----
nix run github:nix-community/nixos-generators -- --flake .#graphical-installer --format iso --out-link result
----

You could also get the ISO by getting the `packages.graphical-installer-install-iso` from the flake output.

[source, shell]
----
nix build $FLAKE#graphical-installer-install-iso
----

With the ISO built, you can now use it for yourself for whatever reason.
